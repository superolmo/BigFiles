# Structure
The plugin is developed based on the Plugin template from Don Ho at https://github.com/npp-plugins/plugintemplate
Big files are read using a small customizable 100kB per page. No files are kept open. An internal structure keeps track of page number for every file opened by the plugin.

# Minimum Scope of Work
1. Plugin must be able to preview very large files in Notepad++ independent of the language (Multi-Byte)
2. Plugin must be able to move viewable page changing page backward or forward, and to jump to start or end

# Current Version Change Log
- Fixed Error on closing bug
- Fixed reloading of updated configuration without restarting Notepad++

# Future Work v0.2.0.0
- Add settings dialog and bigfiles.ini for changing page size
- Improve classification of file type [Text, Binary, ZIP, PDF, etc.] and activate Hex-Editor if it is installed
- Open sequence of files. Ex: data1.csv + data2.csv + etc.
- Search for regex in the file by auto forwarding to next page
- (Maybe) Change behaviour when moving from page to page in a text file to truncate at \n\r.
